# Getting Started

## Building the Compiler

Caboose is fairly new so we haven't had the time to package it for different OSes yet, therefore you will have to build it from source.

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

```
// Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
